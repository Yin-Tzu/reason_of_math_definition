from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_convex_function

1. If the function takes −\infty  as a value then −\infty  is necessarily the global minimum value and the minimization problem can be answered; this is ultimately the reason why the definition of "proper" requires that the function never take −\infty  as a value. 

2. Assuming this, if the function's domain is empty or 

3. if the function is identically equal to +\infty  then the minimization problem once again has an immediate answer. 

Extended real-valued function for which the minimization problem is not solved by any one of these three trivial cases are exactly those that are called proper.
